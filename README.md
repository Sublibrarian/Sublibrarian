- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sublibrarian
- 👀 I’m interested in Flyfishing, Darts, Chess, Absinthe history, Poetry, alternative music as well as classical (champer, prepared piano)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning not to stop learning. As a non-developer, I plan to make mor out of Github and from my co-workers. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small project, mainly text based but lets see what CoPilot can help me with
- 📫 How to reach me ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I tend to spand over too many hobbies - keeping tarantulas is part of my dark past
